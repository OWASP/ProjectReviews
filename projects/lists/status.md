## Low-Activity

Projects might have a recession period of activity, especially after they have reached a certain level of maturity, however the content could be outdated based on the amount of time (6 months/ 1 year) .

## Inactive

Projects become inactive in those occasions where a project leader:

* **is no longer able to manage their project**

* **has not been able to find a suitable replacement for the leader role**

* **feels his/her project has become obsolete**

Hence, the **Project Abandonment Form** was put in place for such occasions.

The OWASP **Project Abandonment Form** gives current project leaders an easy way of letting the OWASP Foundation know that they wish to resign their project leader duties.

Under these circumstances, the acting project leader is encourage to submit the **Project Abandonment Form**.

**Once a request has been received, the project in question will be archived and labeled as an Inactive project**.
