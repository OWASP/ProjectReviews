# Builders, Breakers and Defenders

The idea of OWASP Communities is to bring together experts in the area that they are best at with the common goal of advancing the state of application security.

This approach allows similar groups of professionals and experts to tackle security problems with the involvement of the most relevant stakeholders.

The intent is to drive high quality output that is immediately usable by the target audience.

## Breakers

A community of security professionals and stakeholders with the common goal of advancing the state of security in the area of **security testing**.

## Builders

A community of security professionals and stakeholders with the common goal of advancing the state of security in the area of **application development**.

## Defenders

A community of security professionals and stakeholders with the common goal of advancing the state of security in the area of **application defense, including the tools and techniques that enable the detection and response to application layer attacks**.
